COMP5590 Assessment 1
In this assessment you will practice writing “user stories” for capturing requirements of a new
software system. You will work as part of a group. Each member will produce two user stories,
participate in a conversation about other members’ user stories and present one of their user stories
in a class.
The scenario
The assessment centres around the main project, in which your group needs to implement part of a
GP booking system. The customer is giving you only a general idea of the features required (those
are available in the main project description). This assignment represents a typical first step of the
development of such system. You want to understand what exactly the customer wants to build.
Your group has been assigned with one interface (either patient, receptionist/admin, or doctor). In
this assignment you need to capture requirements for eight features for the interface you will be
working on:
• Two for the authentication and authorisation features
• Six (a group of 4) or eight (a group of 5) for the features in the interface assigned to your
group
In other words, each member will need to produce two user stories. In each group, one or two of the
members need to work on user stories for authentication and authorization.
Concretely, you need to define a requirement specification by following the following three steps.
Phase 1 - Write user stories
User stories are discussed in detail in the Thursday lecture on Week 25. They are short, simple
descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability,
usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:
As a <type of user>,
I want <some goal>,
so that <some reason>.
Each member of the group will be the owner of two user stories.
What to put in your submission: Provide all the user stories that your group created and clearly
indicate who is the owner of each user story. Please provide these in a single document (Word or
PDF file).
Phase 2 - Conversation about user stories
Once you have a user story, the next step is to have a conversation with the customer or a user about
the story to obtain additional details. You want to talk to the non-technical user to understand what
exactly they need.
In this phase, your group should work together. For each of the user stories, one person should be
the “customer” and everyone else will play the role of the “developers”. The developers should
capture the additional information provided by the customer. As part of this, you may even revise
the original user story if you get a clearer idea about what the customer needs. You will need to
write notes about the conversation. Those should not be literal transcriptions, but a readable
2
summary written as a couple of sentences. The write- up should be accessible to the customer, so it
should not contain technical language (about how you might implement this). Be careful to retain
the language of the user and not to stray into development speak.
What to put in your submission: Include the notes from the conversation in the document with the
user stories. For each of the user story, you should have a couple of sentences from the discussion.
Mark clearly which members of your group played what role. Who was the customer and who were
the developers?
Phase 3 - Presenting a user story in class
Each member of the group needs to choose one of the two stories they lead and present it to the
class supervisor and other students in the Week 28 or Week 29 classes (Groups A, B, E are
scheduled for Week 28 and groups C, D, F for Week 29). As a group, you will need to provide a
slide presentation (e.g., one slide for each story). Each group member will have two minutes to
present the story and conversation notes, and three minutes to answer questions from other students
or the class supervisor. Be ready to justify your choices, and take note of feedback from supervisors
and other students.
What to put in your submission: The slides from your presentation. Please make sure to mark
who is the owner of each of the presented user stories.
Submission
The material for phases 1 and 2 should be submitted as a single file (Word or PDF). Slides for Phase
3 should be submitted as another file (PowerPoint or PDF). The submission needs to be done by one
member of each group and needs to be done via Moodle by the deadline.
Assessment marking
• 3 marks for each user story that you lead (max 6 marks for the two stories)
A good story is relevant, useful, at the right level of detail and abstraction and uses
appropriate jargon. There are details of a conversation that give a reasonable idea of the
scenario.
• 3 marks for the presentation during class
A good presentation is clear and within time boundaries, with reasonable details, and the
student is able to justify the approach in the question & answers phase of the presentation.
• 1 mark for raising good point as a “customer” in the conversations about other stories
